        <p>
            I have always loved to eat since i was a kid and fried rice has always been my favourite dish to eat.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Origin of fried rice</b>
            <br>
            <br>
               Fried rice is thought to have originated in the city of Yangzhou in the eastern Jiangsu province of China, northwest of Shanghai, made from whole grain rice and many other ingredents and its preparation is different acrross different places and regions.it's not an indigenous Nigerian meal but has been incorporated into one of Nigerian's finest and mostly comusmed dishes.
            <br>
